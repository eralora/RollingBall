My first project in Unity 

I did my project inspired by Brackeys channel on YouTube. 

I added a few new features as Coutdown timer, new Colider system for player, showing score and save High score for each level, GameOver menu which can give player choose PlayAgain or Quit and another little features.

Game is not fully finished yet. In the future I would like to add new prefabs instead of cubes, fix player particle system and change overall UI.
